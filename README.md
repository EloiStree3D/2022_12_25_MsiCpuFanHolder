My Fan broke and the replacement will arrive in month. Let's build an external fan system to continue working.


V0: Stupid version that did not work but teach me how to hook a square fan to 3D print.

V0.1: First version to blow in the computer from the outside... Before realizing that I was blowing the GPU instead of the CPU that I need to blow.

I need to create a version with a bit of death to avoid the screen to move the air system.
